# My Tower Defense Game in Pygame

I've been working on a **tower defense game** using Pygame, and I wanted to document what I’ve built so far. The game features **A* pathfinding for enemies**, allowing them to dynamically navigate around obstacles toward a **home base in the center of the screen**. I've also added **placeable walls**, which force enemies to find a new route when blocked.

## 🛠️ Features Implemented So Far

✅ **A* Pathfinding for Enemies** – Enemies calculate the shortest route to the base and adjust dynamically if blocked.  
✅ **Grid-Based Movement** – The game runs on a tile-based grid system, making it easy to manage paths and obstacles.  
✅ **Home Base at the Center** – The enemies’ goal is to reach and attack the base in the middle of the map.  
✅ **Placeable Walls** – I added a **right-click mechanic** to place or remove walls, blocking enemy movement.  
✅ **Real-Time Path Recalculation** – When walls are placed, enemies **immediately find a new path** if possible.  
✅ **Debugging Path Visualization** – I highlight the enemy’s path on the grid to visualize how the A* algorithm works.

## 🎮 How It Works

- **Enemies Spawn** at a predefined location (currently the top-left corner).
- **Enemies Use A*** to **navigate to the home base**, choosing the shortest possible route.
- **Players Can Place Walls** by **right-clicking** on the grid.
- **Walls Block Enemy Movement**, forcing them to reroute.
- **Right-Click Again to Remove a Wall**, reopening paths.

## 🔧 What I Want to Add Next

Here’s what I’m planning for the next steps:

1️⃣ **Multiple Enemies** – Right now, I only have a single enemy moving toward the base, but I want to introduce waves of attackers.  
2️⃣ **Tanks That Destroy Walls** – Some enemy types should be able to break walls instead of just rerouting.  
3️⃣ **Different Enemy Types** – Speed-based units, flying units (that ignore walls), or stronger, slower enemies.  
4️⃣ **Towers That Attack** – At some point, I need actual towers that fire at enemies instead of just walls for blocking.

## ✍️ Code Overview

Here's the core logic so far:

### 1️⃣ **A* Pathfinding**
I implemented **A* (A-Star) pathfinding**, which allows enemies to find the shortest path to the base. If a wall is placed, they **recalculate dynamically**.

### 2️⃣ **Grid System**
The game runs on a **tile-based grid** where each tile is either:
- `0` = Walkable  
- `1` = Wall  
- `2` = Home Base  

This makes it easy to check valid paths and update the enemy’s navigation when walls are placed.

### 3️⃣ **Enemy AI**
The enemy follows **waypoints generated by A***, moving toward the home base in small steps. If a wall is placed in its way, it **reroutes automatically**.

### 4️⃣ **Player Interaction**
Right-clicking allows the player to **place a wall** on the grid. If an enemy was moving through that space, it will **find a new route**.

## 📌 Summary

So far, I’ve got **A* pathfinding, real-time enemy movement, and dynamic wall placement** working. The game is starting to feel interactive, and the next step is to introduce **multiple enemies, destructible walls, and actual towers that attack**.

What do you think? Let me know if you have ideas for what I should add next! 🚀
